            No one knows what it's like <br>
            To be the bad man <br>
            To be the sad man <br>
            Behind blue eyes <br>
            And no one knows what it's like <br>
            To be hated <br>
            To be fated to telling only lies <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            But my dreams they aren't as empty <br>
            As my conscience seems to be <br>
            I have hours, only lonely <br>
            My love is vengeance <br>
            That's never free <br>
            </p>

            <div class="kek">
            No one knows what its like <br>
            To feel these feelings <br>
            Like I do <br>
            And I blame you <br>
            No one bites back as hard <br>
            On their anger <br>
            None of my pain and woe <br>
            Can show through <br>
            </div>
            But my dreams they aren't as empty <br>
            As my conscience seems to be <br>
            I have hours, only lonely <br>
            My love is vengeance <br>
            That's never free <br>
            <div class="kek azaza">
            No one knows what its like <br>
            To be mistreated, to be defeated <br>
            Behind blue eyes <br>
            An no one know how to say <br>
            That they're sorry and don't worry <br>
            I'm not telling lies <br>
